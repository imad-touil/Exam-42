Alongside of using diamond inheritance to define the has() function for both
(1) searchable_tree_bag and (2) searchable_array_bag, the assignment seems
to want to test our debugging capabilities by making us

a. add a declaration in tree_bag.hpp
    tree_bag& operator=(const tree_bag &src);
b. update a function declaration in tree_bag.hpp
    from:   static void *copy_node(node *);
    to:     node *copy_node(node *);
